## In The Report
Include your responses to the bold questions on your own fork of [this lab report template](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab2). Include snippets of code that explain what you did. Deliverables are due next Tuesday. Post your lab reports as README.md pages on your GitHub, and post a link to that on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Solder your LCD panel

**Take a picture of your soldered panel and add it here!**

## Part B. Writing to the LCD
 
**a. What voltage level do you need to power your display?**
I'm not sure, I went to the Hitachi webpage, but still didn't understand. 

**b. What voltage level do you need to power the display backlight?**
I'm not sure
   
**c. What was one mistake you made when wiring up the display? How did you fix it?**

I didn't understand that the numbers on the breadboard didn't correspond to those on ground and +. I forgot to connect certain wires for this reason. To fix it, I switched the wires. 

**d. What line of code do you need to change to make it flash your name instead of "Hello World"?**

lcd.print("hello, world!")
to
lcd.pring("Natalie")

But it isn't flashing...

**e. Include a copy of your Lowly Multimeter code in your lab write-up.**

## Part C. Using a time-based digital sensor

**Upload a video of your working rotary encoder here.**


## Part D. Make your Arduino sing!

**a. How would you change the code to make the song play twice as fast?**
 
**b. What song is playing?**


## Part E. Make your own timer

**a. Make a short video showing how your timer works, and what happens when time is up!**

**b. Post a link to the completed lab report your class hub GitHub repo.**
